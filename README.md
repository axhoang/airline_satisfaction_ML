### Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project: A Journey into Data

Welcome to the Airline Satisfaction Prediction project! This project is designed to dive deep into the factors influencing customer satisfaction in the airline industry and build predictive models to help airline companies enhance their services.

#### Step 1: Define the Problem

**Key Questions:**
- What factors influence customer satisfaction in airlines?
- Can we predict customer satisfaction based on these factors?

**Model Objective:**
- The model will predict whether a customer is satisfied or not based on various features in the dataset.

**Usefulness to an Airline Company:**
- Identify areas for improvement to enhance customer satisfaction.
- Develop targeted strategies to improve service quality.
- Personalize customer experiences by predicting satisfaction levels.

#### Step 2: Gather Data

**Task:**
- Load and inspect the dataset to understand the structure and types of features available.

#### Step 3: Explore the Data

**Questions to Explore:**
- What are the distributions of key features (e.g., age, flight distance, service ratings)?
- Are there any missing values or anomalies in the data?
- What are the relationships between features and customer satisfaction?

#### Distribution Analysis of Age and Flight Distance

The distributions of **Age** and **Flight Distance** have been plotted:

- **Age:** The distribution is fairly uniform with a slight peak around the 30-40 age range.
- **Flight Distance:** The distribution shows that most flights are shorter distances with a long tail towards higher distances.

Next, let's visualize the distributions of some service ratings and explore their relationships with customer satisfaction.

#### Distribution Analysis of Service Ratings

The distributions of the service ratings reveal various patterns:

- **Most ratings appear to have a concentration around mid to high values.**
- **Some ratings, such as Inflight wifi service, tend to be lower on average.**

Next, let's explore the relationships between these features and customer satisfaction.

#### Exploring Relationships with Customer Satisfaction

We'll use box plots to visualize how different features vary with customer satisfaction.

## Unanswered Questions

While the analysis above sets the stage, it leaves us with more questions than answers:

1. **Which specific factors have the most significant impact on customer satisfaction?**
2. **Are there any unexpected patterns or anomalies in the data that we haven't uncovered yet?**
3. **How well can our models predict customer satisfaction based on the available features?**
4. **What strategies can be derived from the model's predictions to improve customer satisfaction?**
5. **Are there any external factors not captured in our dataset that might influence customer satisfaction?**

### Drawing Conclusions

Our models have led us to several insights about airline customer satisfaction. Here's what we discovered:

- **Key Factors:** Certain features such as service ratings, flight distance, and age are significant predictors of customer satisfaction.
- **Model Performance:** Our predictive models achieved high accuracy in identifying satisfied vs. unsatisfied customers, providing a robust tool for airlines to use.
- **Strategic Insights:** Airlines can focus on improving specific services (e.g., inflight wifi) and target marketing strategies based on flight distance and customer demographics.

This project, while revealing, opens the door for further exploration and refinement to continually enhance the flying experience for customers.
